### Welcome to the Bamazon CLI App
Welcome to the Bamazon App, running on JavaScript, MySQL and Node.js. When you run the app from the terminal, a table will pop up with all of the products available for purchase. The user can then select from the list of products and place an order, all from the command line! 

#### Enter Product ID
When the app is initiated, a table will pop up with all of the products available for purchase. The user will be automatically prompted to enter the ID for the product they would like to buy.

#### Choose Quantity 
Once they enter the product ID, they will be prompted to choose the quantity.

#### If Order Exceeds Stock
If the the quantity exceeds the stock for their selected product, the order will not go through and they will be rerouted to continue shopping.

#### If Order is in Stock
If we have enough of their specific product in stock, the total will be displayed and the user will be asked if they would like to continue shopping. If yes, the products table will appear again with updated stock quantities and they can place another order.

#### When Done Shopping
If the user does not want to continue shopping, the total will be displayed and they will be instructed to bring me their total in ca$h.
